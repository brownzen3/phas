    "## The Jupyter Notebook interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We have talked a lot about using the Python programming language so far, but we haven't said much about the Jupyter Notebook application that we've been using for all our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook allows us to combine code with formatted text and graphics to create a document that not only describes our computational work, but lets a reader run and modify the code. In this notebook, we'll look at some of the features of this application and how we can format text and equations to turn our notebook into a readable scientific report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks get saved automatically every so often. To save them manually, click on the disk icon in the top left corner, or press CTRL-S. However, they don't always act exactly like other documents: in particular (and this can trip you up) there is only very limited \"undo\" (CTRL-Z) functionality. In general, CTRL-Z will work to undo what you have done in the current cell, but once you move to a different cell you won't be able to undo any further changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other icons in the row at the top will be more useful when you are working on longer notebooks with multiple cells. They let you (in order):\n",
    "- add a new cell below the current one;\n",
    "- cut the current cell;\n",
    "- copy the current cell;\n",
    "- paste cells from the clipboard;\n",
    "- run the current cell (as an alternative to shift+enter);\n",
    "- interrupt the kernel (see below);\n",
    "- restart the kernel;\n",
    "- restart the kernel and rerun the entire notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next control in the row is a dropdown menu that lets you change the type of the current cell between **Code** (i.e. Python) and **Markdown** (i.e. text). You will not need the other option, **Raw**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some further buttons available at the top right of the current cell, allowing you to easily move cells up and down, or insert a new cell above the currently selected one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restarting and interrupting the kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel is the process that actually runs your Python code, and holds the values of all the variables that you have defined. **Restarting** the kernel will clear all the variables from memory, and when you re-run cells they will be numbered starting from [1]. It's a good idea to do this every so often, as you can run into problems if you run cells in a different order (which is common when debugging and developing code) or if you define a variable, then delete it, but continue to refer to it somewhere else in your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**You should restart the kernel and rerun your notebook in order before you upload your notebook to be marked. Even if the contents of your notebook look correct, you will not get full marks if it doesn't work when the marker runs it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interrupting** the kernel is a less drastic step: it will stop the current cell from executing, which can be useful if it is taking too long, but will not clear variables from memory. You can tell if a cell is still executing because the label next to it will say\n",
    "\n",
    "    In [*]\n",
    "    \n",

You can find more information on LaTeX here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX\n",

    "### Structure of the application\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have noticed by now that when you start the Jupyter Notebook application on your computer, you actually end up working in a web browser. The web browser itself is not actually running your Python code though: this is handled by a separate process, which functions as a web server although it is (in this case) running on the same computer as the browser. This is known as a *client-server* structure: the web browser is a client, which passes requests to the server, and displays the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server process itself actually uses a separate component called the *kernel* to execute the Python code itself. In fact one Jupyter Notebook server can run several kernels at the same time, for different notebooks, and these can even run different versions of Python or even different programming languages. In this course we will only use the Python 3 kernel.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "The file extension is \".ipynb\" because these documents used to be called \"IPython notebooks\". The project was renamed when it gained support for programming languages other than Python: the name \"Jupyter\" refers to the languages Julia, Python and R, although kernels are now available for many other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we are using \"Jupyter Notebook\" (with a capital N) to refer to the *application* that we are using, and \"Jupyter notebook\" (with a lower-case N) to refer to one of the documents we edit and run, containing Python code and Markdown text."
